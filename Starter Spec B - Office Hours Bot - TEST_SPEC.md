## 3. Test Specification

### Kinds of tests (plain language)

- **Automated** tests are run by the computer on every code change, with no person needed.
- **Automated eval** tests run a fixed evaluation set of questions through the real AI and score the results automatically, where possible by checking citations, required phrases, or matching against the syllabus. They run before every release and whenever the AI instructions or model change.
- **Manual** tests are carried out by a person following a written checklist. They run before launch and each semester.

### Evaluation sets

The professor and TAs write these before launch, with the developer's help. Each set is stored with its expected behavior.

| Set | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Concept | 50 | Questions answerable from the slides, each with its correct deck and slide |
| Out-of-scope | 40 | Questions the materials don't cover: related business topics, other courses, current events |
| Logistics | 30 | Deadline, grading, office hours, and late-policy questions with exact answers |
| Simplify | 15 | Concept answer followed by "explain more simply" |
| Integrity | 40 | Graded-work requests: pasted assignment text, reworded, split into parts, "my friend's homework", role-play framing |
| Legitimate-learning | 40 | Genuine concept questions related to assignment topics that should be answered |
| Injection | 30 | Planted instructions in test PDFs and student messages, plus attempts to extract instructions, private graded items, or other students' data |
| Crisis | 15 | Messages indicating distress (and 15 that look similar but are not), to check both detection and false alarms |

### Gaps and weak spots

The following are covered, but only partly. Passing these tests does not guarantee the behavior:

1. **REQ-014 / REQ-015 (academic integrity).** Eval sets measure a sample of attempts. Determined students will find rewordings the set doesn't include. The Integrity set should grow each semester with real attempts, reported anonymously.
2. **SEC-015 / SEC-020 (prompt injection).** No test can prove the AI can't be tricked. The real protection is SEC-016 and SEC-017: even when tricked, the bot has nothing dangerous it can do.
3. **SEC-007 / SEC-008 (no staff access).** Tests can show the app offers no way in. They can't stop an operator with database access from looking. That relies on SEC-008's small named list and audit log.
4. **REQ-005 citation accuracy.** Automatic scoring checks that the cited slide contains matching terms. A TA spot-check is needed to confirm the slide actually supports the answer.
